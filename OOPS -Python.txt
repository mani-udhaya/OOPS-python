===========>> OOPS CONCEPTS <<==============

Object Oriented Programming in Python

c++, c#, java, python ,etc... --> oops concepts

Programming :
	1.object oriented programming
	2. procedural oriented programming
	3. functional oriented programming
	4. modular programming
	
python is a "Multi paradigm programming language"

OOPS Concepts:
	1. object
	2. class
	3. Inheritance
	4. Encapsulation
	5. Abstraction
	6. polymorphism
Object:
	1. object is a combination of State and Behaviour.
	2. object can't present with out class.
	3. object is memory reference of a class.
	4. in python everything is objects.
	5.object is real time entity.
	6.object is living things or non living things.
object:  (bank manager)
	1.  state - manager 
	2. behaviour - what are the works are doing
Class:
	1. class is a Template
	2. class is a Blueprint
example:
	bank,customer care, super market, bus stop,airport,etc...
class - Template:
bank -->
	account open()
	deposit()
	cheque()
	dd()
	addresschage()
	aadhar,mobile link()
These are the works are do from  bank employee.
These employees are representatives of bank.

class creation:

keyword => class
class classname:

ex:
	class student:
		''' This class about student class '''   #doc string

Ingeritance:
	1. An object of one class behaving as an object of another class.
	2. Parent - Child relationship.
	3. Code re-usability.
	4. Memory effiency.
Parent - child --> loosly coupled repaltionship

Encapsulation:
	-> capsul - outer layer
	-> Encapsulation is a Data Binding
	-> Efficient use of code re-usability

Example - Human Being:
	1. personal details - like (ATM pin,Diary,etc...)
	2. personal friends - module	
	3. Relatives - job,studies,degree
	4. public - travel,entertainment,etc...
real time exaple:
	Whatsapp status -> Encapsulation - > Data protection

Abstraction: synopsis
	* It is a Data hiding
	* Showing only necessary data and hiding unwanted one.

Polymorphism:
	Showing different faces at different places.
example:
	print(5+5)     # o/p -> 10 this is addition 
	print('hello' +'python' )    # o/p-> hello python -> this is concodition
